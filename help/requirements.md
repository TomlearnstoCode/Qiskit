# Requirements

All package requirements for the QCBQ can be installed by executing

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

where the file `requirements.txt` is in the root directory of the QCBQ repository

[https://github.com/rmlarose/QCBQ](https://github.com/rmlarose/QCBQ).

If you need a package `X` and only want to install this package (and its dependencies), execute

```bash
pip install X
```

at a command line.
