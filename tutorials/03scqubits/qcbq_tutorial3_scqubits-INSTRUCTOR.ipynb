    "To a physicist a qubit is any two level quantum system, or two levels of a higher dimensional quantum system that we can isolate. For example, we could make a qubit out of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, with $|0\\rangle$ being the spin down configuration and $|1\\rangle$ being the spin up configuration. We could also make a qubit out of the $n=0$ (ground) and $n=1$ (first excited) states of a quantum harmonic oscillator (provided we have a way of isolating those two states from the rest of the harmonic oscillator ladder!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Superconducting qubits take the second route: physicsts and engineers use **Josephson junctions**, a type of superconducting element that acts like a nonlinear inductor, to create **anharmonic oscillators** to use as qubits. When quantized, a regular LC oscillator (left) is simply a harmonic oscillator, with equal energy level spacings ($\\hbar\\omega_{01} = \\hbar\\omega_{12} =~...$). In this configuration, even if we only want to work with the $n=0$ and $n=1$ states, there is nothing stopping us from accidentally exciting the oscillator into the $n=2,3,4...$ states. However, when we replace the inductor with a josephson junction (right) we get an anharmonic oscillator with $\\hbar\\omega_{01} \\neq \\hbar\\omega_{12}$. The unevenly spaced energy levels allow confine ourselves to the the lowest two levels (the **computational subspace**) of the harmonic oscillator ladder, and call those two levels our qubit.\n",

The T2 time is a measure of how long qubits can \"stay coherent.\" Superconducting qubits are described aptly by the qubit and drive Hamiltonians. We implement single qubit gates on superconducting qubits by sending microwave pulses through control lines at them. Qiskit `Pulse` provides low-level functionality to control these pulses."

The Hamiltonian transforms as $\\tilde{H} = RHR^{\\dagger} + i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial t}R^{\\dagger}$, where, for the case of transforming into the frame rotating in the drive, $R = e^{-\\frac{i\\omega_dt}{2}\\sigma_z}$. It is also perfectly valid to go into the frame rotating with the qubit (as is done in \"Quantum engineer's guide to superconducting qubits\"), however this frame becomes problematic when discussing dephasing, which may be viewed as the frequency of the qubit stochastically changing. Since the drive frequency is typically well controlled relative to the qubit frequency, we generally work in the frame rotating with the drive.\n",

    "1. Superposition and coherence are basis-dependant. That is, the existence of coherence depends on the particular basis one is using. For example, the state $|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle$ is a coherent superposition of the computational basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, but it is one of the $X$-basis states $|+\\rangle$. So, in the computational basis, this density matrix does have off-diagonal elements, but in the $X$-basis this density matrix would be diagonal. For the discussion in the main notebook, we always use coherence to mean coherence in the computational basis. Decoherence causes a decay to some \"preferred basis\" (which happens to be the computational basis in superconducting qubits). "
