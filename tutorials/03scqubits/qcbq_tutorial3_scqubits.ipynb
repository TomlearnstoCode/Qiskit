    "To a physicist a qubit is any two level quantum system, or two levels of a higher dimensional quantum system that we can isolate. For example, we could make a qubit out of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, with $|0\\rangle$ being the spin down configuration and $|1\\rangle$ being the spin up configuration. We could also make a qubit out of the $n=0$ (ground) and $n=1$ (first excited) states of a quantum harmonic oscillator (provided we have a way of isolating those two states from the rest of the harmonic oscillator ladder!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Superconducting qubits take the second route: physicsts and engineers use **Josephson junctions**, a type of superconducting element that acts like a nonlinear inductor, to create **anharmonic oscillators** to use as qubits. When quantized, a regular LC oscillator (left) is simply a harmonic oscillator, with equal energy level spacings ($\\hbar\\omega_{01} = \\hbar\\omega_{12} =~...$). In this configuration, even if we only want to work with the $n=0$ and $n=1$ states, there is nothing stopping us from accidentally exciting the oscillator into the $n=2,3,4...$ states. However, when we replace the inductor with a josephson junction (right) we get an anharmonic oscillator with $\\hbar\\omega_{01} \\neq \\hbar\\omega_{12}$. The unevenly spaced energy levels allow confine ourselves to the the lowest two levels (the **computational subspace**) of the harmonic oscillator ladder, and call those two levels our qubit.\n",

    "1. Superposition and coherence are basis-dependant. That is, the existence of coherence depends on the particular basis one is using. For example, the state $|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle$ is a coherent superposition of the computational basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, but it is one of the $X$-basis states $|+\\rangle$. So, in the computational basis, this density matrix does have off-diagonal elements, but in the $X$-basis this density matrix would be diagonal. For the discussion in the main notebook, we always use coherence to mean coherence in the computational basis. Decoherence causes a decay to some \"preferred basis\" (which happens to be the computational basis in superconducting qubits). "
